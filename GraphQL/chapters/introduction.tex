\section{Why GraphQL}
We all know that REST contributes more towards API development. In recent years, REST has become the dominant style for creating web services that are reusable and manageable. Everything in REST is represented as a resource which in turn has a unique URI to get identified. Also, REST works with a set of HTTP methods/verbs to define the operations being performed on the REST resources. Each one of us, the developers, will accept that REST is a great approach to proceed with API development as 

\begin{itemize}
  \item {It leverages the usage of the standard HTTP protocol}
  \item {It is stateless}
  \item {It supports caching}
  \item {It is light-weight}
  \item {It supports multiple representations for resources and so on}
\end{itemize}
