## Day2:

### Containers:

- On Prem (install the runtime)
- ACI (only for POC not for prod) need container runtime (eg. Docker) by default provisions only one container
- Arc -enabled
- AKS -> language service
  user -> containers -> FQDN
  container images
- [NER(Named Entity Recognition)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/named-entity-recognition/how-to/use-containers)
- billing -> endpoints
- EULA (end user licence agreement) -> accept
- API key -> access key

disconnected environment supported by containers (contact azure support, purchase commitment tier)

[Azure AI containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-container-support)

Container instances -> create container service
Nvidia V100 tensor go
Azure AI services always Linux

Containers used so that client data remains on premises

### Security:

1. CMK(Customer Managed Key)/MMK(Microsoft Managed Key):
   Powered by (key vault) generate keys in key vault and import in your data.
2. Support of TLS 1.2: by default.(secure socket) client should be compatible with TLS 1.2. Old clients may not be.
3. Customer Lockbox: when we create ticket for training failing due to corrupted data.
4. Virtual Network:
5. Access Keys: -> service principal

az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <name> --scope <scope>
